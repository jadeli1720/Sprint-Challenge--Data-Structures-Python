"""
Using original code, it takes 9.9 seconds to find duplicates
There are 64 duplicates total
runtime: O(n^2) ?

Navigate both names directories and make the runtime more efficient to find duplicates.
runtime = second

Can use one of the data structures we worked on in week's projects

CONSTRAINTS: cannot use list

input: both lists
output: duplicates only

Questions: 
1. Will we need to put both in binary search trees
2. Can  we separate the two loops?


PLAN: 
Use data structure from week's project that has best runtime: Binary search tree O(log n)
Import it
name_1
name_2

Pass in the names_1 into BST
loop through names_1 and insert into BST

Use contains to check names_2 against names_1

BST has values
roots
left and right

# ---------- Stretch Goal -----------
# Python has built-in tools that allow for a very efficient approach to this problem
# What's the best time you can accomplish with no restrictions on techniques or data
